Welcome to the PQ pair programming exercise!

You & your partner have 90min to work on the exercises below. Make sure to first carefully read this file as well as the `README.md` before getting started. The exercise is designed in a way that should leave plenty of time to finish all the tasks. Don't be surprised if you finish early!

Please use whatever IDE or developer tools that you would usually use in your day-to-day. We also encourage you to use any online resources and please feel free to use ChatGPT.


# Exercise #1

Follow the installation instructions in the `README.md`. Then try a conversion from mmCIF to PDB file format by using one of the files in `data/mmcif_file`. Verify that everything is working as expected on the `master` branch.


# Exercise #2

Check out another branch with a new feature. Use a debugger to resolve the bug.


# Exercise #3

In the README the tool claims that it can do mmCIF->PDB as well as PDB->mmCIF conversions. However, the tool is currently only able to convert from mmCIF->PDB. Stay on the current branch and implement the PDB->mmCIF conversion.


# Exercise #4

When converting larger numbers of files you notice that the tool is quite slow. Analyse the code base, find the bottleneck(s) and improve its runtime!

# Exercise #5

If you happen to have extra time, let's make sure that this project is ready to be open-sourced: Clean up the code base as you see fit, ensure high code quality and maybe even implement a simple CI pipeline.
